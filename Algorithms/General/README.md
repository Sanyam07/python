# General Algorithms

This page contains some non-categorised algorithms that are useful in day to day analysis

## Gaussian Mixture Model
https://mdav.ece.gatech.edu/ece-6254-spring2017/notes/20-GMMs-EM.pdf
The above paper considers the entire covariance matrix while calculating the probabilities

However, instead of taking the entire covariance matrix, i have taken only diagonal values

### TODO

This is another implementation of an approximation of the covariance matrix
