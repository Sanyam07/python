# Recommender Systems 
Recommender Systems are the backbone of any transactional selling model

## CollaborativeFilteringSVD
This performs Collaborative Filtering on the SVD results for an input data

## VanillaRBMRecommender
[Restricted Boltzmann Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_Boltzmann_machine) are simple yet powerful tools for mimicking gradient descent learning. Here we see how we can use this for coming up with recommendations

This is the [Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Collaborative Filtering paper](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/rbmcf.pdf)
It covers Unit 2 within the paper. Other units are work in Progress
