## Memory Profiler
I am using guppy which is an awesome memory profiler </br>
https://pypi.org/project/guppy/

I have encapsulated this in a class which can run asynchrnously with the rest of your processing . Following are the features
 * Easy to start
 * Easy to stop
 * Easy to retreive the memory footprint
 
People are welcome to extend it with other object level metrics and CPU information
