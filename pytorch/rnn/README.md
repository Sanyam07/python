# RNN
Recurrent Neural Networks have become the backbone of neural network solutioning

## LSTMWithAttention
Attention Networks is the most common way to enforce explanability on the neural networks. I have implemented the following paper </br>

## BiDirectional LSTM
This is much better in finding temporal patterns for prediction

## Hierarchial Attention Network

This is an algorithm that has seen an increased adoption in dealing with sequential and time series data analysis
