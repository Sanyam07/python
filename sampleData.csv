DREAM TEAM,"1. Star selection</br>
The Dream Team is a portfolio that invests in the best 30 companies in the world.</br></br>

The strategy starts from filtering the world universe by the best brands according to brand research specialists. Then companies’ financials are analysed and companies ranked according to well-established factors including value, growth, momentum, quality, sentiment, balance sheet strength, low risk and ESG metrics.</br></br>

Brand can be seen as a key component of the concept of moat used by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger used to select “Great businesses at fair prices”. If anything, the value of brands tend to grow with the globalisation and digitalisation of consumption.</br></br>

2. Teamwork</br>
The final selection identifies the leaders by sector and balances the portfolio by country, region and currency according to global equity indices weights so that the portfolio is well diversified.</br></br>

LQD,"This kkk is the most popular option for investors looking to gain exposure to investment grade corporate bonds, making it a useful tool for those looking to access a corner of the bond market that should be a core component of any long-term, buy-and-hold portfolio. LQD is probably of limited use for short term traders, who will prefer to utilize more extreme ends of the risk spectrum to capitalize off of short term movements in asset prices and risk tolerance. This ETF should, however, be very useful to those building a long-term portfolio; exposure to corporate bonds can deliver attractive yields without excessive risks. LQD can specifically be helpful for those with holdings in AGG or BND, beefing up the relatively minor allocations those aggregate products make to corporate debt (those ETFs are dominated by government bonds). While LQD is spread out across the maturity spectrum, investors do have options for more granular exposure to long term (VCLT) or short term (SCPB, VCSH) corporate debt. LQD is extremely cost efficient, and offers an impressively deep underlying portfolio of fixed income securities. But there are some interesting alternatives out there that may make more sense for certain investors. CBND, for example, offers similar exposure but uses a unique weighting methodology that may be more appealing. Whereas LQD gives the largest weightings to the biggest issues of debt, CBND uses fundamental factors such as return on assets and interest coverage ratio to determine the weightings assigned.",1,ZERO_TO_TWO,"[1, 509]",2017-10-04 10:40:30.276,SGD,163.7192958,-0.00904741682748527

Investors with a longer-term horizon should consider the importance of large cap value stocks and the benefits they can add to any well-balanced portfolio including dividends and rock solid stability. Companies within this segment are often considered some of the safest firms in the world and tend to be in more stable industries as well, potentially skewing some portfolios that are heavy in value securities. VIG is linked to an index consisting of roughly 140 holdings and exposure is tilted most heavily towards consumer, health care, and industrials. Securities are chosen for inclusion in the fund based on their history of increasing dividends; only companies that have increased payouts for at least ten consecutive years are included in the fund. Thanks to this focus, SDY only invests in companies that are most likely to continue to pay out dividends in the future making it a solid pick for dividend focused investors even if the diversification is a little lacking.

ALD,"This kkk offers exposure to debt issued by Asian governments and corporations, making ALD a potentially useful tool for investors looking to add some international holdings to the fixed income portion of their portfolios. Most ETFs in the Total Bond Market ETFdb Category (such as AGG and BND) consist entirely of debt from U.S. issuers. Diversifying bond exposure beyond U.S. borders has the potential to add both diversification and return enhancement benefits, making a fund such as ALD a potentially valuable addition to a long-term, buy-and-hold portfolio. This fund can also be used in connection with more tactical, shorter-term strategies. ALD includes debt from about a dozen different countries, including both developed and emerging Asian economies (Japanese debt is excluded). That means that exposure is diversified across a number of different currencies and issuers (the portfolio includes both sovereign and corporate bonds). ALD will generally offer yields that exceed debt of U.S. issuers, making it attractive for those looking to beef up current returns and willing to take on some additional risk. It should be noted that investors in this fund are exposed to risks associated with exchange rate movements; a strengthening dollar may hurt the value of ALD. Investors seeking exposure only to emerging markets issuers may want to consider ELD, while those looking for exposure to bonds from primarily developed markets outside the U.S. may consider those in the International Government Bonds ETFdb Category (or PICB for international corporate debt).",1,ZERO_TO_TWO,"[1, 509]",2017-10-04 10:52:49.969,SGD,62.890380332,0.0197645896358467

BEST OF FUNDS (EQUITY) WITH SAFE - INSURANCE,"An entry level investment strategy which auto selects a basket of the best performing mutual funds, both Equity and Debt, while adding a SAFE downside protection. The fund selection is done using kkk's proprietary algorithm. 

The SAFE feature, is a downside put protection bought at 95pc NIFTY strike. This put compensates the investor for any fall in the general market. (ex: If the NIFTY falls 30%, the investor gains 25% from the Put). The uniquness of this strategy lies in the fact that while absolute risk weighted returns are maximised by kkk's alogorithms, the SAFE feature dramatically reduces the downside risks to the portfolio. ( Please see chart). The combination of optimised diversified portfolio and downside protection allows passive investment, eliminating the need for continuous market tracking and involvement. Presently the fund will be investing in 40% Small and medium cap funds and remaining in large cap funds and purchasing a NIFTY put at 95% strike. We recommend a 3-15 year hold horizon for this strategy. 

This strategy is ideal for individuals looking for a long term endowment fund for children’s education or retirement. These individuals to are looking for double digit returns to match their investment goals. They have a bullish view on India and feel the Indian stock markets would offer them these returns. However since the investments are long term and endowment in nature, they cannot afford principal loss or long periods of negative return. Also they want the long term portfolio to be ""managed"" with auto re-balancing of their holdings. The product will afford high relative return in most market scenarios.

This fund will be more attractive to those looking to put a tactical tilt towards health care stocks in place or as a tool in a sector rotation strategy. One noteworthy element of this ETF is the depth of holdings; with hundreds of individual stocks, VHT casts a considerably wider net than other health care ETFs such as XLV. But this fund is still somewhat concentrated; a small handful of stocks account for a significant portion of the total portfolio, while many of the smaller names have very minor weightings. VHT is also appealing from an expense perspective; the ER is one of the lowest in the ETFdb Category, and commission free trading in Vanguard accounts may further increase the appeal to cost conscious investors.

Though this ETF could be used in long-term portfolio, it's probably most useful as a tactical tool for shifting exposure to this segment of the market for a shorter period of time. As the name suggests, DVYA maintains a relatively shallow portfolio of stocks, which results in some material concentrations in a small handful of names. Also, there are some predictable sector tilts in the underlying portfolio, with sectors that are known as big dividend payers receiving some big allocations (though, on the whole, DVYA spreads exposure across all segments of the Asia Pacific economy).

Like most Vanguard ETFs, VPU is among the cheapest options available for investors seeking exposure to the asset class represented (XLU and FUI are also low cost options for utilities exposure). This ETF may be available for commission free trading in Vanguard accounts, potentially increasing the appeal to cost conscious investors. Another noteworthy element of this ETF is the impressive depth of holdings; VPU has considerably more individual stocks than XLU.

Stocks are selected to ensure that there is a strong exposure to the right sectors in terms of growth, value and momentum.</br></br>

- Growth: EPS growth, Sales growth and EBITDA growth estimates are used to assess forecasts of markets and sectors.</br>
- Valuation: The PE, PB and EV/EBITDA, and growth rates for the major equity markets globally and their equity sector indices are looked at for a sense of whether each market has priced in less or more growth. Technical indicators are used to confirm if PE, EV/EBITDA and PB valuations are overbought or in oversold territory.</br>
- Momentum Indicators: These are run for each country and its sectors across different time frames.</br></br>

The weight of Stocks is based on how strong their multi-year growth prospects are. Stocks are monitored for shifts in their growth prospects and momentum. Stocks are sold if they get over-valued, or their growth engines are affected or they fall out of momentum. A small amount of contrarian positions are retained.</br></br>

Net Squared kkk identifies securities utilizing yet another style of investing developed by Benjamin Graham, Net Net is the shorthand method for identifying business to invest in based solely on assets and not earning power.</br></br>

Companies will be identified by comparing its market value based on shares outstanding times share price to that of its asset less all liabilities value. Assets is defined as Cash & its equivalents at full face value, reducing accounts receivable for doubtful accounts and reducing inventories to liquidation values. Liabilities are taken at full value and further reduced from assets. If this value is greater than its market capitalization the stock will be identified as a net net. This was particularly fruitful in the post WWII era (and to some extent post GFC) when a large number of stocks were trading at a massive discount to its asset value. It is one of the most conservative ways to invest in a stock as it assigns no value to future growth (if any), purely how much value will be retained post paying down all liabilities and stripping the company bare off its assets. Buffett and Munger adopted this technique initially, when they were playing with small amounts of money.</br></br>

Please see chart for a comparative returns and risk matrix. Presently the fund will be investing in 15% Debt, 40% Small and medium cap funds and remaining in large cap funds. Rebalancing will happen every quarter. We recommend a 2-5 year hold horizon for this strategy. </br></br>

This strategy is ideal for individuals who want to pick the best performing mutual funds. The individuals however don't want to concentrate the holdings across one or two funds. Since the best performers change from time to time, they also want to auto re-balance their holdings. Lastly they want risks to be tightly managed and would prefer diversifying the holdings across debt and equity. This product would have better risk-reward ratio, (Sharpe ratios of top 30 funds vs Sharpe ration of kkk) and lower volatility as measure by standard deviation. ( std of top 30 funds vs Std of kkk). Passive investors looking for reasonably high returns with managed risks would find this product suitable. The product is oriented towards growth not asset preservation and individuals who want downside protection or have a very long term hold period where equities might go through long downward cycles should go the option with the SAFE feature.",1,TWO_TO_FIVE,"[39, 511]",2017-10-25 04:51:12.265,INR,11233.5521894487,0.0909266169464243
VAW,"This ETF is one of several funds offering exposure to the U.S. materials sector, a corner of the market that may be appealing for investors looking to gain indirect exposure to commodity prices through the stocks of companies engaged in the extraction or production of natural resources. Because the materials sector often accounts for a small portion of broad-based benchmarks, VAW may be a useful tool for long-term investors looking for more balanced exposure to the U.S. equity market. It can also be handy for those looking to implement a shorter-term tilt towards the materials sector. The most appealing attributes of VAW are the depth of holdings (more than 125 individual stocks) and low fees, though there are some big allocations in a few of the larger names and XLB and FBM are both cheaper from an expense ratio perspective. This ETF is also available for commission free trading in Vanguard accounts, potentially increasing the appeal to cost-conscious investors. Those seeking more balanced materials exposure may prefer RTM, while those looking to avoid U.S. stocks completely have IRV as an option.",1,ZERO_TO_TWO,"[1, 509]",2017-10-04 10:55:50.298,SGD,194.0075688,0.0882367529559204
MACAU GAMING/ CASINOS,This is a momentum kkk based on current positive trends coming out of the Macau market. The sector has already rallied sharply over the last 1 year and trends point towards continued strength. There is limited diversification though it protects against idiosyncratic risks. Industry run rates continue to be strong.  Risks of policy action and further tightening in China remain along with overall market downturn. Sector valuation is also already high at 16x FY17E EV/EBITDA.,5,ZERO_TO_TWO,"[1, 509]",2017-10-31 16:28:08.498,HKD,205839.447335038,0.175489592176678
THE MONEY ROLLER - MIDCAP STRATEGY,"Our (www.themoneyroller.com) approach has been to construct a well-diversified portfolio of stocks with a long-term perspective. We continue to hold on to stocks that fall out of favour if we believe that the fundamentals are still strong. Though growth stocks form a large component of our portfolio, we have also tried to capitalise on emerging opportunities in value/cyclical stocks. Thus, our objective has been to build a diversified portfolio with a mix of growth and value stocks provided they meet our investment criteria. We follow a bottom-up approach to stock selection wherein we look to invest in fundamentally sound companies across sectors through a dynamic blend of growth and value styles of investing. The companies that we seek to invest in are (a) well managed; (b) generate high ROCE and (c) demonstrate the ability to deliver sustainable growth in earnings.",5,ZERO_TO_TWO,[39],2017-12-04 13:35:01.624,INR,6416.8,0.0988988406144572
