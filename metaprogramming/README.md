# This module lays down some examples of MetaProgramming in Python
MetaPgramming is a powerful and underutilised concept in Python. The following will attempt to lay down some usecases which all will find beneficial

## EnforceDocString.py Enforcing docstring in all classes and functions
The enforceDocstring.py helps you write a simplistic code to enforce docstring in classes and functions. Once can change it based on requirements

## RecordFunctionExecutionTimings.py Recording function execution timings
The RecordFunctionExecutionTimings.py helps you record the timings for each of the function call that is made. This is very helpful for webservice call functions where you want to track the timings. You obviously do not want multiple decorators but a simple metaclass suffices
