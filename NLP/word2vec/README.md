# WORD2VEC

Creating Word Embeddings has been a challenging exercise especially with large volumes of data </br>

## GLOVE
GLOVE[https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/] has been one of the most used word embeddings in todays industry. We will take a peek into how this algorithm is structured [https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf] </br>
We will take sample movie reviews and have added some preprocessing code as well, so you can ignore that part, if you want to take a look at just GLOVE implementation
