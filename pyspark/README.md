# PYSPARK
This page will be catering to several implementations of python and several ML algorithms

## UTILITIES

### Removing First Row ( dropfirstRow )
There are many ways of removing 

### Generating Row Index ( generateRowIndex )
Generating a row index has always been challenging in a distributed environment. This code will help you do that

## ACCUMULATORS
Accumulators are like global variables which you can use in lambda functions in python. When you are doing a map on a spark dataframe and you want some global variables, then these accumulator variables comes in handy

## ALGORITHMS

### KDTREE 
KD-Tree is one of the simplest algorithms to break down a large dataset into smaller subsets. This makes us easier to run other algorithms like KNN etc on top of it
